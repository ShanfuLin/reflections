What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

After a repository is initialise, it remains empty because no files have as yet been committed. Commits are stored in repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the original location which the files are stored. As the name suggests, the staging area is a location where files are placed into before commitments are made. The repository is the location where files have been committed.
